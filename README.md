# Artificial-Intelligence-In-Bioinfromatics

Computer Science and Information Technology Professionals are being employed in many diverse areas of Science. In this project are focusing on Bioinformatics and the 
knowledge and skills to understand and participate in this field of research or as an advance step to greater employment opportunities. This project will clarify the fundamentals of Bioinformatics from the end user perspective and will allow us to participate in information gathering.
I answered the following questions in the project:

Question 1:
A) Describe two ways in which big data analytics changed the way we study human
genome? 
B) List 3 primary sequence databases along with their respective URL’s for obtaining 
DNA and Protein sequence. 
C) List 3 protein structure databases with their respective URL’s. 
D) What is Genome? List three genome databases with their respective URL’s.
E) How important is machine learning for bioinformatics in the given scenario?

Question 2:
Bioinformatics is an intelligent method for obtaining biological knowledge using 
computational techniques. In this question we will execute a work- flow to produce a 
biological outcome.
We will investigate COVID-19 sequence regarding the current virus we are fighting!
Note: A virus is a shell of fat with a RNA sequence inside. Once it attaches itself to it’s
host (A human’s cell for example) it inserts its RNA into the cell and the cell begins 
replicating (translating) the virus’s RNA sequence. The researches at NCBI have transcribe 
this RNA sequence back to DNA to extract more information. Therefore the follow sequences are DNA sequences. 

2.1 NCBI Gene Database
Use the NCBI Gene Database to investigate the COVID-19 virus for Homo sapiens. We will 
be analyzing nucleocapsid phosphoprotein [Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]. 
From this list of information please answer the following.
A) Briefly describe the function of this virus 
B) With the limited study available so far, elucidate the function of this particular gene 
N ?

2.2 Predict Protein sequence
Download the COVID19 nucleotide sequence and protein sequence to their respective FASTA 
file. Paste the nucleotide sequence into GeneID. 

https://genome.crg.cat/software/geneid/geneid.html.

Answer the follow questions (In your own words):
A) Briefly describe the difference between the predicted protein and the NCBI protein 
sequence and why. 
B) What tool could you use to more accurately predict the protein sequence? 

2.3 Swiss Model
Scroll to the (NCBI Reference Sequences) section and click the protein sequence, which will 
begin with YP_ You, will be taken to the entry in NCBI Protein. Select “FASTA”, Click ‘Send 
to File’ to save the protein sequence. Paste your protein sequence into 
https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive. Answer the follow questions (In your own words):
A) Which protein does the sequence have most coverage? 
B) What percent is the sequence identity. 
C) What is the template used to build this model?
D) Please attach a screenshot of the Model’s sequence alignment, the template, and the 
model generated as .pdb file 

2.4 BLAST
Go to NCBI BLAST www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast. Select ‘protein blast’ and paste the protein 
sequence saved from 2.3. Execute the search with the ‘swissprot’ database excluding Coronavirus 
(taxid:694002), Coronavirus group 1b (taxid:693996). 
A. Pastes the results obtained into your report and provide a brief analysis of the result. 
B. Download the protein sequence with highest similarity and also discuss about the sequence. 
C. As in question 2.3, generate a 3D model for the similar sequence using Swiss Mode.
D. Provide the screenshot of your result page.
E. Compare it with the human protein structure generated in 2.3, what do you observe by 
comparing two structures?
